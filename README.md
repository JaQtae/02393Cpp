# 02393Cpp
Code repo for 02393 Programming C++ at DTU Lyngby, Denmark.


### Notes
For this course we recommended using the g++ compiler of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). As C++ editor, the recommendation is Microsoft Visual Studio Code with its C++ extension.
Otherwise, for initial purposes a online compiler may be used such as [this one](https://cpp.sh/).

### Code hand-in for weekly exercises
The course uses AutoLab for grading via CodeJude-esque setup. This can be found [here](https://autolab.compute.dtu.dk/auth/users/sign_in), however you *need a DTU VPN Connection* or be present at DTU Campus to access the website.
In order to log-in to AutoLab, you must use your DTU email address (your-student-id@student.dtu.dk). In particular, the domain must be student.dtu.dk.
